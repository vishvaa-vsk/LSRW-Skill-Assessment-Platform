# Platform Modernization & Security Recommendations

## 1. Frontend Modernization: React for Multi-Page App

- **React is suitable for multi-page apps** when combined with a router (e.g., React Router).
- You can build a "multi-page" experience as a Single Page Application (SPA) with React Router, or use a hybrid approach (React for test-taking, server-rendered for static/download pages).
- For your use case:
  - **Test-taking flows**: Use React for rich interactivity, restrictions, and security.
  - **Reports/certificates/downloads**: Can remain as server-rendered or simple React pages, since these are less interactive.

## 2. Test Security & Restrictions

- **Prevent Tab Switching**: Use the Page Visibility API and `window.onblur`/`onfocus` events to detect tab switches and warn/block the user.
- **Disable Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add event listeners for `keydown` and block keys like F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, Alt+Tab, PrintScreen, etc.
- **Disable Context Menu**: Add `oncontextmenu={e => e.preventDefault()}` at the document or root React component level.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Consider forcing fullscreen during tests and monitoring for exit.
- **Session Monitoring**: Log suspicious activity (tab switches, shortcut attempts) and optionally auto-submit or flag the test.

## 3. Device Targeting

- **Test-taking**: Optimize React UI for desktop/laptop only (use responsive design to block or warn on mobile/tablet).
- **Other Features**: Allow certificate/report downloads from any device (keep these as simple, accessible pages).

## 4. Deployment Considerations

- **PythonAnywhere**: Continue serving the Flask backend as an API and for static files.
- **React Build**: Build the React app (`npm run build`) and serve the static files via Flask or a CDN.
- **Custom Domain**: No special changes needed for React; just ensure routing is handled (Flask should serve `index.html` for unknown routes if using client-side routing).

## 5. General Recommendations

- **API-First**: Move business logic to Flask REST API endpoints.
- **Frontend/Backend Separation**: Develop React and Flask as separate projects for easier maintenance.
- **Security**: Continue to address path traversal and DOM injection issues as previously discussed.

## 6. Migration Plan: HTML/CSS to React

### Step 1: Project Structure

- Create a new directory, e.g., `frontend/` at the root.
- Initialize a React app:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app frontend
  ```
- Organize components by feature (e.g., `Test`, `Dashboard`, `Reports`, `Auth`).

### Step 2: Routing

- Use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation.
- Define routes for each major page (login, dashboard, test, reports, etc.).

### Step 3: UI Migration

- Migrate each HTML template to a React component.
- Move CSS to component-level CSS or use CSS modules.
- Replace Jinja2 variables with React state/props.
- Use [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) or Material UI for consistent styling.

### Step 4: API Integration

- Refactor Flask backend to expose RESTful APIs for all data operations.
- Use `fetch` or `axios` in React to interact with backend endpoints.

### Step 5: Test Security Features

- Implement tab switch detection, keyboard shortcut blocking, and context menu disabling in the test-taking React component.
- Use browser APIs as described in previous suggestions.

### Step 6: Device Restriction

- In the test-taking component, detect device type and block/warn if not desktop/laptop.

### Step 7: Build & Deployment

- Build React app (`npm run build`).
- Serve the static build via Flask (or a CDN).
- Update Flask to serve `index.html` for unknown routes (for client-side routing).

### Step 8: Gradual Rollout

- Migrate one feature/page at a time.
- Test thoroughly after each migration.

**Tip:**  
Keep the backend and frontend in separate folders and repositories if possible. Use environment variables for API URLs and secrets.

---

**Summary:**  
React is a good fit for your use case, especially for the interactive, security-sensitive test-taking experience. Use React Router for navigation, enforce test restrictions via browser APIs, and keep download/report features accessible from all devices. Maintain a clear separation between frontend and backend for scalability and maintainability.

**Ready to start?**  
Begin by creating the React app and migrating the login and dashboard pages first. Ask for a sample migration for any specific page to get started!
