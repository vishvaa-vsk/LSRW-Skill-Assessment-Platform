## üìù Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/LSRW-Skill-Assessment-Platform.git
   cd LSRW-Skill-Assessment-Platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
   - Update connection details in `src/extensions.py` if needed.

4. **Configure Email**
   - Set up SMTP credentials in `src/send_email.py`.

5. **Environment Variables (`.env` Management)**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root (same directory as `src/`).
   - Add all sensitive configuration here, such as:
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_db
     MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
     MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
     TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=your_token_secret
     ```
   - The application loads these variables automatically using `python-dotenv` (see `src/config.py` and `src/helper.py`).

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=src
   flask run
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.
