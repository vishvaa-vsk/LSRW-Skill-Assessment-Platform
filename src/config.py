# `load_dotenv(path.join(basedir,".env"))` is a function call that loads the environment variables
# from a file named `.env` located in the same directory as the script. The

# `basedir` (which is the absolute path to the directory containing the script) with the `.env` file
# name. The `load_dotenv()` function then reads the contents of the `.env` file and sets the
# environment variables accordingly.
